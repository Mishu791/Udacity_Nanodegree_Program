# Flight Performance 

## Dataset

This dataset was selected from the list provided by Udacity. It is the Flights dataset that reports flight performance metric in the US. Data explored and analyzed is from years 2007-2008. The data is available from Bureau of Transportation Statistics official website.

## Summary of Findings

In the Exploration it is found that, the staple of the highest of delays were carrier or weather related problems. American Airlines was the worst performing carrier with highest delays and cancellations in the year 2007 and 2008. Interestingly, 'WN' has the highest Departure Delay.

Moreover, relationship in between arrival and departure delay has been investigated. The relationship in between these two are trivial.
'WN' as a carrier has conducted more Flights and the percentage of delay is also high in terms of total number of flights. AS AirTime increases the possibility of delays decreases (according to regression line).


## Key Insights for Presentation

The plots shown in presentation actually gives the insights of the datasets. The plots are made in such a way so that Arrival and Departure delay can be compared. In Multivariate Exploration impact of AitTime has been investigated, which means whether the flights are prone to delay or not, when the destination is so far or the AirTime(duration) is large.
